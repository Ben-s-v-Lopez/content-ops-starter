#### Overview

The Sustainable Finance Compliance and Monitoring System (SFCMS) is an innovative solution designed to combat greenwashing in the financial sector. Greenwashing involves companies misleading stakeholders by falsely claiming their products or practices are environmentally friendly. Our system leverages advanced data science techniques to ensure transparency and accountability in sustainable finance.

#### Team Members

*   **Ben Lopez**: Masters student in Data Science and Analytics at Brunel University.

*   **Diya Martin**: Masters student in Clinical Psychology at Kingston University.

#### Objectives

*   Detect and prevent greenwashing in financial disclosures and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reports.

*   Enhance the Financial Conduct Authorityâ€™s (FCA) ability to monitor and enforce compliance in sustainable finance.

#### Methodology

1.  **Predictive Modelling with Random Forest**:

    *   Trained on historical financial data and compliance records to predict potential greenwashing.

2.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**:

    *   Employed sentiment analysis and entity recognition to scrutinize corporate reports, regulatory filings, and social media for inconsistencies.

3.  **Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest**:

    *   Continuously monitored ESG data and financial transactions in real-time to detect unusual patterns indicating non-compliance or fraud.

#### Technology Stack

*   **Cloud Computing**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalable infrastructure.

*   **Programming**: Python for model development.

*   **Data Processing**: Apache Kafka for real-time data integration.

#### Implementation

1.  **Data Collection**:

    *   Gathered extensive datasets including financial disclosures, ESG reports, regulatory filings, and social media data.

2.  **Model Development**:

    *   Developed and fine-tuned models in Python to ensure accuracy and low false-positive rates.

3.  **Integration and Deployment**:

    *   Integrated models into a unified system hosted on AWS for real-time monitoring.

4.  **User Interface**:

    *   Created intuitive dashboards for FCA regulators to visualize flagged cases and model outputs.

#### Benefits

*   **Enhanced Detection**: Improved identification of greenwashing.

*   **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous compliance analysis.

*   **Increased Transparency**: Boosted trust among investors and consumers.

#### Recognition

Our project was recognized at the FCA's DiFoR conference, where we received an award for our innovative approach to sustainable finance. This accolade highlights the impact and potential of our system in fostering a more transparent and trustworthy financial market.

#### Conclusion

The SFCMS is a significant advancement in the fight against greenwashing, promoting sustainable finance through cutting-edge data science and machine learning. We are passionate about using these technologies to address real-world problems and look forward to further contributions to the industry.
